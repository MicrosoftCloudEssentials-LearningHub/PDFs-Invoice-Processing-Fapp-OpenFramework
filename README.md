## Important Considerations for Production Environment

<details>
  <summary>Private Network Configuration</summary>

 > For enhanced security, consider configuring your Azure resources to operate within a private network. This can be achieved using Azure Virtual Network (VNet) to isolate your resources and control inbound and outbound traffic. Implementing private endpoints for services like Azure Blob Storage and Azure Functions can further secure your data by restricting access to your VNet.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Security</summary>

  > Ensure that you implement appropriate security measures when deploying this solution in a production environment. This includes: <br/>
  >
  > - Securing Access: Use Azure Entra ID (formerly known as Azure Active Directory or Azure AD) for authentication and role-based access control (RBAC) to manage permissions. <br/>
  > - Managing Secrets: Store sensitive information such as connection strings and API keys in Azure Key Vault. <br/>
  > - Data Encryption: Enable encryption for data at rest and in transit to protect sensitive information.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Scalability</summary>

  > While this example provides a basic setup, you may need to scale the resources based on your specific requirements. Azure services offer various scaling options to handle increased workloads. Consider using: <br/>
  >
  > - Auto-scaling: Configure auto-scaling for Azure Functions and other services to automatically adjust based on demand. <br/>
  > - Load Balancing: Use Azure Load Balancer or Application Gateway to distribute traffic and ensure high availability.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Cost Management</summary>

  > Monitor and manage the costs associated with your Azure resources. Use Azure Cost Management and Billing to track usage and optimize resource allocation.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Compliance</summary>

  > Ensure that your deployment complies with relevant regulations and standards. Use Azure Policy to enforce compliance and governance policies across your resources.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Disaster Recovery</summary>
   
> Implement a disaster recovery plan to ensure business continuity in case of failures. Use Azure Site Recovery and backup solutions to protect your data and applications.

</details>

## Prerequisites

- An `Azure subscription is required`. All other resources, including instructions for creating a Resource Group, are provided in this workshop.
- `Contributor role assigned or any custom role that allows`: access to manage all resources, and the ability to deploy resources within subscription.
- If you choose to use the Terraform approach, please ensure that:
  - [Terraform is installed on your local machine](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/azure-get-started/install-cli#install-terraform).
  - [Install the Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) to work with both Terraform and Azure commands.

## Where to start? 

> Please follow as described below.

- If you're choosing the `Infrastructure via Azure Portal`, please start [here in this section](#step-1-set-up-your-azure-environment).
- If you're choosing the `Infrastructure via Terraform` approach:
    1. Please follow the [Terraform guide](./terraform-infrastructure/) to deploy the necessary Azure resources for the workshop.
    2. Then, follow each [each section](#step-1-set-up-your-azure-environment) but `skip the creation of each resource`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Regarding `Networking`, this example will cover `Public access configuration`, and `system-managed identity`. However, please ensure you `review your privacy requirements and adjust network and access settings as necessary for your specific case`.

## Overview 

> Using Cosmos DB provides you with a flexible, scalable, and globally distributed database solution that can handle both structured and semi-structured data efficiently. <br/>
>
> - `Azure Blob Storage`: Store the PDF invoices. <br/>
> - `Azure Functions`: Trigger on new PDF uploads, extract data, and process it. <br/>
> - `Azure SQL Database or Cosmos DB`: Store the extracted data for querying and analytics. <br/> 

| Resource                  | Recommendation                                                                                                      |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Azure Blob Storage**    | Use for storing the PDF files. This keeps your file storage separate from your data storage, which is a common best practice. |
| **Azure SQL Database**    | Use if your data is highly structured and you need complex queries and transactions.                                  |
| **Azure Cosmos DB**       | Use if you need a globally distributed database with low latency and the ability to handle semi-structured data.      |

## Function App Hosting Options 

> In the context of Azure Function Apps, a `hosting option refers to the plan you choose to run your function app`. This choice affects how your function app is scaled, the resources available to each function app instance, and the support for advanced functionalities like virtual network connectivity and container support.

> [!TIP]  
>
> - `Scale to Zero`: Indicates whether the service can automatically scale down to zero instances when idle.  
>   - **IDLE** stands for:  
>     - **I** – Inactive  
>     - **D** – During  
>     - **L** – Low  
>     - **E** – Engagement  
>   - In other words, when the application is not actively handling requests or events (it's in a low-activity or paused state).
> - `Scale Behavior`: Describes how the service scales (e.g., `event-driven`, `dedicated`, or `containerized`).  
> - `Virtual Networking`: Whether the service supports integration with virtual networks for secure communication.  
> - `Dedicated Compute & Reserved Cold Start`: Availability of always-on compute to avoid cold starts and ensure low latency.  
> - `Max Scale Out (Instances)`: Maximum number of instances the service can scale out to.  
> - `Example AI Use Cases`: Real-world scenarios where each plan excels.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Azure Environment

> An Azure `Resource Group` is a `container that holds related resources for an Azure solution`.
> It can include all the resources for the solution or only those you want to manage as a group.
> Typically, resources that share the same lifecycle are added to the same resource group, allowing for easier deployment, updating, and deletion as a unit.
> Resource groups also store metadata about the resources, and you can apply access control, locks, and tags to them for better management and organization.

1. **Create an Azure Account**: If you don't have one, sign up for an Azure account.
2. **Create a Resource Group**:
   - Go to the Azure portal.
   - Navigate to **Resource groups**.
   - Click **+ Create**.

       <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56d1e99f-0a22-4492-bd6f-d4e3a76aedd8">

   - Enter the Resource Group name (e.g., `RGContosoAI`) and select a region (e.g., `East US 2`). You can add tags if needed.
   - Click **Review + create** and then **Create**.

       <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/324c1157-9566-4b30-bb36-bd0efb0a1bf3">

## Step 2: Set Up Azure Blob Storage for PDF Ingestion

> An `Azure Storage Account` provides a `unique namespace in Azure for your data, allowing you to store and manage various types of data such as blobs, files, queues, and tables`. It serves as the foundation for all Azure Storage services, ensuring high availability, scalability, and security for your data. <br/> <br/>
> A `Blob Container` is a `logical grouping of blobs within an Azure Storage Account, similar to a directory in a file system`. Containers help organize and manage blobs, which can be any type of unstructured data like text or binary data. Each container can store an unlimited number of blobs, and you must create a container before uploading any blobs.

1. **Create a Storage Account**:
   - In the Azure portal, navigate to your **Resource Group**.
   - Click **+ Create**.

      <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd4579b3-2f95-4a24-b9ef-178ee14c9e98">

   - Search for `Storage Account`.
  
       <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09616373-c3b2-459c-89b8-59c6db6beaea">

   - Select the Resource Group you created.
   - Enter a Storage Account name (e.g., `contosostorageaidemo`).
   - Choose the region and performance options, and click `Next` to continue.

        <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4db31956-2d36-4581-98cf-ec0e68d55037">

   - If you need to modify anything related to `Security, Access protocols, Blob Storage Tier`, you can do that in the `Advanced` tab.

        <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d3da139-6e7a-4bb6-a695-deb1c314ccd3">

   - Regarding `Networking`, this example will cover `Public access` configuration. However, please ensure you review your privacy requirements and adjust network and access settings as necessary for your specific case.
  
       <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0273e197-6e5b-4a1c-93cc-7597730c384b">

   - Click **Review + create** and then **Create**. Once is done, you'll be able to see it in your Resource Group.

        <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b61b79c-9f3f-47f0-b59f-6720edebe41e">

2. **Create a Blob Container**:
   - Go to your Storage Account.
   - Under **Data storage**, select **Containers**.
   - Click **+ Container**.
   - Enter a name for the container (e.g., `pdfinvoices`) and set the public access level to **Private**.
   - Click **Create**.

        <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b4900e3-7ce8-42aa-b5d9-c2fbb2417721">

## Step 3: Set Up Azure Cosmos DB

> `Azure Cosmos DB` is a globally distributed,`multi-model database service provided by Microsoft Azure`. It is designed to offer high availability, scalability, and low-latency access to data for modern applications. Unlike traditional relational databases, Cosmos DB is a `NoSQL database, meaning it can handle unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data types`. `It supports multiple data models, including document, key-value, graph, and column-family, making it versatile for various use cases.` <br/> <br/>
> An `Azure Cosmos DB container` is a `logical unit` within a Cosmos DB database where data is stored. `Containers are schema-agnostic, meaning they can store items with different structures. Each container is automatically partitioned to scale out across multiple servers, providing virtually unlimited throughput and storage`. Containers are the primary scalability unit in Cosmos DB, and they use a partition key to distribute data efficiently across partitions.

1. **Create a Cosmos DB Account**:
   - In the Azure portal, navigate to your **Resource Group**.
   - Click **+ Create**.
   - Search for `Cosmos DB`, click on `Create`:
     
      <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ecdb9a17-5623-4dc0-a607-92448950b7a0">

   - Choose your desired API type, for this will be using `Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL`. This option supports a SQL-like query language, which is familiar and powerful for querying and analyzing your invoice data. It also integrates well with various client libraries, making development easier and more flexible.

       <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db942359-8a81-4289-9ea7-91234b4c3802">

   - Please enter an account name (e.g., `contosocosmosdbaidemo`). As with the previously configured resources, we will use the `Public network` for this example. Ensure that you adjust the architecture to include your networking requirements.
   - Select the region and other settings.
   - Click **Review + create** and then **Create**.

       <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42b415d3-0d38-4b69-9e18-7bc4015b4a6d">

2. **Create a Database and Container**:
   - Go to your Cosmos DB account.
   - Under **Data Explorer**, click **New Database**.

      <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f816576-8160-444c-8abc-086b450d98b1">

   - Enter a database name (e.g., `ContosoDBAIDemo`) and click **OK**.

## Step 4: Set Up Azure Functions for Document Ingestion and Processing

> An `Azure Function App` is a `container for hosting individual Azure Functions`. It provides the execution context for your functions, allowing you to manage, deploy, and scale them together. `Each function app can host multiple functions, which are small pieces of code that run in response to various triggers or events, such as HTTP requests, timers, or messages from other Azure services`. <br/> <br/>
> Azure Functions are designed to be lightweight and event-driven, enabling you to build scalable and serverless applications. `You only pay for the resources your functions consume while they are running, making it a cost-effective solution for many scenarios`.

### Create a Function App

- In the Azure portal, go to your **Resource Group**.
- Click **+ Create**.

    <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/efac220b-72db-447b-98a7-58196b3d39dd">

- Search for `Function App`, click on `Create`:

    <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/571c2880-cff7-4ed5-9840-2f1b5f58ce46">

- Choose a `hosting option`; for this example, we will use `Consumption`. Click [here for a quick overview of hosting options](https://github.com/brown9804/MicrosoftCloudEssentialsHub/tree/main/0_Azure/3_AzureAI/14_AIUseCases/0_PDFProcessingFAOF#function-app-hosting-options):
       
    <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8bd30c5-7b21-4aac-adf2-6e1dc5ec509a">

- Enter a name for the Function App (e.g., `ContosoFunctionAppAI`).
- Choose your runtime stack (e.g., `.NET` or `Python`).
- Select the region and other settings.

  <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e32fb474-c954-475b-971e-599f9909d35a">

- Select **Review + create** and then **Create**. Verify the resources created in your `Resource Group`.

- To assign the `Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/readMetadata` permission, you need to create a custom role in Azure Cosmos DB. This permission is required for accessing metadata in Cosmos DB. Click [here to understand more about it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/security/how-to-grant-data-plane-role-based-access?tabs=built-in-definition%2Ccsharp&pivots=azure-interface-cli#prepare-role-definition).

    | **Aspect**         | **Data Plane Access**                                                                 | **Control Plane Access**                                                                 |

This includes actions such as creating, deleting, and configuring databases and containers. |
    | **Roles**          | - `Cosmos DB Built-in Data Reader`: Provides read-only access to data within the databases and containers. <br> - `Cosmos DB Built-in Data Contributor`: Allows read and write access to data within the databases and containers. <br> - `Cosmos DB Built-in Data Owner`: Grants full access to manage data within the databases and containers. | - `Contributor`: Grants full access to manage all Azure resources, including Cosmos DB. <br> - `Owner`: Grants full access to manage all resources, including the ability to assign roles in Azure RBAC. <br> - `Cosmos DB Account Contributor`: Allows management of Cosmos DB accounts, including creating and deleting databases and containers. <br> - `Cosmos DB Account Reader`: Provides read-only access to Cosmos DB account metadata. |
    | **Permissions**    | - `Reading documents` <br> - `Writing documents` <br> - Managing data within containers. | - `Creating or deleting databases and containers` <br> - Configuring settings <br> - Managing account-level configurations. |
    | **Authentication** | Uses `Azure Active Directory (AAD) tokens` or `resource tokens` for authentication.                      | Uses `Azure Active Directory (AAD)` for authentication.                                 |

> Steps to assing it:

1. **Open Azure CLI**: Go to the [Azure portal](portal.azure.com) and click on the icon for the Azure CLI.

     <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2643d9a-7364-454a-bb24-f16270e99d92">

2. **List Role Definitions**: Run the following command to list all of the role definitions associated with your Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL account. Review the output and locate the role definition named `Cosmos DB Built-in Data Contributor`.

     ```powershell
     az cosmosdb sql role definition list \
         --resource-group "<your-resource-group>" \
         --account-name "<your-account-name>"
     ```
    
    <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c19d70e-d525-4c15-bb0e-518f50f61b37">
    
3. **Get Cosmos DB Account ID**: Run this command to get the ID of your Cosmos DB account. Record the value of the `id` property as it is required for the next step.

     ```powershell
     az cosmosdb show --resource-group "<your-resource-group>" --name "<your-account-name>" --query "{id:id}"
     ```

     Example output:
    
     ```json
    {                                                               
      "id": "/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group-name}/providers/Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/{cosmos-account-name}"
    }     
     ```
    
     <img width="750" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3426130-2de5-46a0-96f0-4c6e15e57975">

4. **Assign the Role**: Assign the new role using `az cosmosdb sql role assignment create`. Use the previously recorded role definition ID for the `--role-definition-id` argument, the unique identifier for your identity for the `--principal-id` argument, and your `account's ID and the Function App` for the `--scope` argument. You need to do this for both the Function App to read metadata from Cosmos DB and your ID to access and view the information.
  
     > You can extract the `principal-id`, from `Identity` of the `Function App`:
    
      <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89c524ce-a392-4507-90ad-19becddff923">
    
     ```powershell
     az cosmosdb sql role assignment create \
         --resource-group "<your-resource-group>" \
         --account-name "<your-account-name>" \
         --role-definition-id "<role-definition-id>" \
         --principal-id "<principal-id>" \
         --scope "/subscriptions/{subscriptions-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group-name}/providers/Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/{cosmos-account-name}"
     ```

    <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72e1e4f9-9228-4ec0-aade-20ad4aaa1f4f">

    <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5caea3b9-3e4d-4791-8376-fda4547547bd">

5. **Verify Role Assignment**: Use `az cosmosdb sql role assignment list` to list all role assignments for your Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL account. Review the output to ensure your role assignment was created.
    
     ```powershell
     az cosmosdb sql role assignment list \
         --resource-group "<your-resource-group>" \
         --account-name "<your-account-name>"
     ```

### Configure/Validate the Environment variables

- Under `Settings`, go to `Environment variables`. And `+ Add` the following variables:

- `COSMOS_DB_ENDPOINT`: Your Cosmos DB account endpoint.
- `COSMOS_DB_KEY`: Your Cosmos DB account key.
- `contosostorageaidemo_STORAGE`: Your Storage Account connection string.

    <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab7cdaad-8939-4a82-99e3-5e7cfd24e908">

    <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/effadf44-7304-4185-a55b-1eb76a5ab8b1">

    <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/905aa59c-9083-4cad-8eb8-b73e5712d2df">

- Click on `Apply` to save your configuration.

### Develop the Function

- You need to install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- Install python from Microsoft store:
   
    <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30f00c27-da0d-400f-9b98-817fd3e03b1c">

- Open VSCode, and install some extensions: `python`, and `Azure Tools`.

    <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/715449d3-1a36-4764-9b07-99421fb1c834">

    <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/854aa665-dc2f-4cbf-bae2-2dc0a8ef6e46">

- Click on the `Azure` icon, and `sign in` into your account. Allow the extension `Azure Resources` to sign in using Microsoft, it will open a browser window. After doing so, you will be able to see your subscription and resources.

   <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4824ca1c-4959-4242-95af-ad7273c5530d">

- Under Workspace, click on `Create Function Project`, and choose a path in your local computer to develop your function.

   <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8db80e51-725e-45fe-91b5-7158fd94be8e">

- Choose the language, in this case is `python`:

    <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fb19a1e-bb2d-47e5-a56e-8dc8a708647a">

- Select the model version, for this example let's use `v2`:
 
    <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd46ee93-d788-463d-8b28-dbf2487e9a7f">

- For the python interpreter, let's use the one installed via `Microsoft Store`:

    <img width="741" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3605c959-fc59-461f-9e8d-01a6a92004a8">

- Choose a template (e.g., **Blob trigger**) and configure it to trigger on new PDF uploads in your Blob container.

    <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a4ed541-a693-485c-b6ca-7d5fb55a61d2">

- Provide a function name, like `BlobTriggerContosoPDFInvoicesRaw`:

    <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9cbc7605-8cb3-41f8-b3f7-3dfc9b8e67b5">

- Next, it will prompt you for the path of the blob container where you expect the function to be triggered after a file is uploaded. In this case is `pdfinvoices` as was previously created.

    <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7005dc44-ffe2-442b-8373-554b229b3042">

- Click on `Create new local app settings`, and then choose your subscription.

    <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07c211d6-eda0-442b-b428-cdaed2bf12ac">

- Choose `Azure Storage Account for remote storage`, and select one. I'll be using the `contosostorageaidemo`. 

    <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ca2a494-2716-4b5a-8e7d-caca1eaf88ab">

- Then click on `Open in the current window`. You will see something like this:

    <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59fa0a79-2a23-4864-968f-9f933826dbca">

- Now we need to update the function code to extract data from PDFs and store it in Cosmos DB, use this an example:

 > 1. **Blob Trigger**: The function is triggered when a new PDF file is uploaded to the `pdfinvoices` container. <br/>
 > 2. **PDF Processing**: The read_pdf_content function uses pdfminer.six to read and extract text from the PDF. <br/>
 > 3. **Data Extraction**: The extracted text is processed to extract invoice data. The `generate_id` function generates a unique ID for each invoice. <br/>
 > 4. **Data Storage**: The processed invoice data is saved to Azure Cosmos DB in the `ContosoAIDemo` database and `Invoices` container. 

 > `pdfminer.six` is an open-source framework. It is a community-maintained fork of the original PDFMiner,`designed for extracting and analyzing text data from PDF documents`. The framework is built in a modular way, allowing each component to be easily replaced or extended for various purpose

- Update the `function_app.py`:

  | Template Blob Trigger | Function Code updated |
  | --- | --- |
